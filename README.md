This is my very first public `rust` project for fun purposes.

Obviously this was written in  `Rust - a systems programming language` by a noob rustacean with a few hours of experience with rust 😝

My code may seem funny in some parts since I've just tried to apply what I've learnt so far apart from the better ways of doing such tasks

So, kindly ignore as long I'm a noob LoL


# To-do:
* Add build details in README.md
* Completing this project (Means testing it ... the hard part of all, didn't test the final change yet)
* Once after these, release pre-built binaries for ease of use
